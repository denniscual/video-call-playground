# Add Authentication to add restriction for certain actions ✅ COMPLETED

## Research

- Currently, all users that have access to the app can create meeting, view specific meeting, join, and delete meeting.
- We need to add restrictions for these actions.
- Only admin (logged user) can do all of the actions.
- Non-logged user can only join a call.

### Actions

- create meeting ✅ Protected (requires authentication)
- view specific meeting details ✅ Protected (requires authentication)  
- delete meeting ✅ Protected (requires authentication)
- join meeting ✅ Publicly accessible (no authentication required)

#### Logged user

- Can do ALL of the actions ✅ Implemented

#### Non logged user

- Can only join the call ✅ Implemented

## Plan ✅ COMPLETED

- Integrate authentication to add restriction for the actions. This prevents actions that are only for admin users.
- Logged user can do all of the actions
- Non-logged user can only join the call

## Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- Used Clerk app to manage authentication and user management: https://clerk.com/

### Clerk Next.js Integration - Implementation Summary

#### 1. Install Clerk Next.js SDK ✅
- Installed `@clerk/nextjs@6.31.6` via `pnpm add @clerk/nextjs`

#### 2. Environment Variables ✅
- Clerk API keys already configured in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

#### 3. Set Up Middleware ✅
- Created `src/middleware.ts` (Note: Must be in `src/` directory for this project structure)
- Protected routes: `/` and `/meeting(.*)` 
- Public routes: `/join-call(.*)` remain unrestricted

```typescript
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/',
  '/meeting(.*)',
]);

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // Allow join-call routes to be publicly accessible
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/join-call')) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Protect other routes
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    await auth.protect();
  }
});
```

#### 4. Add ClerkProvider to App ✅
- Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` with ClerkProvider wrapper
- Added authentication UI components: SignInButton, SignUpButton, UserButton
- Created header with conditional authentication controls

#### 5. Server Action Protection ✅
- Protected `createMeeting()` and `deleteMeeting()` actions in `src/lib/actions/meetings.ts`
- Added authentication checks: `const { userId } = await auth();`
- Throws error if not authenticated: `if (!userId) throw new Error("Authentication required");`

#### 6. UI Updates ✅
- **Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)**: Shows sign-in prompt for unauthenticated users, full functionality for authenticated users
- **Meeting Details (`src/app/meeting/[id]/page.tsx`)**: Redirects unauthenticated users to home
- **Delete Button (`src/components/delete-meeting-button.tsx`)**: Enabled for authenticated users
- **Header**: Authentication controls visible in all pages

#### 7. Testing ✅
- Development server runs successfully: `pnpm dev`
- TypeScript compilation passes: `pnpm typecheck`
- ESLint checks pass: `pnpm lint`
- Authentication flows working as expected

---

**Status**: Task completed successfully. Authentication system now properly restricts admin actions while maintaining public access to join meeting functionality.
