# Add Authentication to add restriction for certain actions ✅ COMPLETED

## Research

- Currently, all users that have access to the app can create meeting, view specific meeting, join, and delete meeting.
- We need to add restrictions for these actions.
- Only admin (logged user) can do all of the actions.
- Non-logged user can only join a call.

### Actions

- create meeting ✅ Protected (requires authentication)
- view specific meeting details ✅ Protected (requires authentication)
- delete meeting ✅ Protected (requires authentication)
- join meeting ✅ Publicly accessible (no authentication required)

#### Logged user

- Can do ALL of the actions ✅ Implemented

#### Non logged user

- Can only join the call ✅ Implemented

## Plan ✅ COMPLETED

- Integrate authentication to add restriction for the actions. This prevents actions that are only for admin users.
- Logged user can do all of the actions
- Non-logged user can only join the call

## Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- Used Clerk app to manage authentication and user management: https://clerk.com/

### Clerk Next.js Integration - Implementation Summary

#### 1. Install Clerk Next.js SDK ✅

- Installed `@clerk/nextjs@6.31.6` via `pnpm add @clerk/nextjs`

#### 2. Environment Variables ✅

- Clerk API keys already configured in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

#### 3. Set Up Middleware ✅

- Created `src/middleware.ts` (Note: Must be in `src/` directory for this project structure)
- Protected routes: `/` and `/meeting(.*)` with automatic redirection to `/sign-in`
- Public routes: `/join-call(.*)` and `/sign-in` remain unrestricted
- **Automatic redirection**: Unauthenticated users visiting protected routes are redirected to sign-in

```typescript
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/', '/meeting(.*)']);

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // Allow join-call routes to be publicly accessible
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/join-call')) {
    return;
  }

  // Allow sign-in route to be publicly accessible
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/sign-in')) {
    return;
  }

  // Protect other routes and redirect to sign-in if not authenticated
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    await auth.protect({
      unauthenticatedUrl: new URL('/sign-in', req.url).toString()
    });
  }
});
```

#### 4. Custom Authentication Pages ✅

- **Custom Sign-In Page**: Created `/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]` with Clerk's `<SignIn />` component
- **Seamless UX**: Users stay within the application during authentication
- **Removed Sign-Up**: Only sign-in functionality is available (no user registration)

#### 5. Add ClerkProvider to App ✅

- Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` with ClerkProvider wrapper
- **Updated UI**: Replaced modal authentication with navigation links to custom pages
- Header shows only "Sign in" button for unauthenticated users
- Authentication controls integrated in header

#### 6. Server Action Protection ✅

- Protected `createMeeting()` and `deleteMeeting()` actions in `src/lib/actions/meetings.ts`
- Added authentication checks: `const { userId } = await auth();`
- Throws error if not authenticated: `if (!userId) throw new Error("Authentication required");`

#### 7. UI Updates ✅

- **Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)**: Simplified to show only authenticated content (no auth prompts)
- **Meeting Details (`src/app/meeting/[id]/page.tsx`)**: Server-side auth check with redirect
- **Delete Button (`src/components/delete-meeting-button.tsx`)**: Enabled for authenticated users  
- **Header**: Shows "Sign in" link for unauthenticated users, UserButton for authenticated
- **Automatic redirection**: Unauthenticated users are seamlessly redirected to sign-in

#### 8. Environment Configuration ✅

- **Custom Auth URLs**: Added environment variables for seamless experience
```
CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
```

#### 9. Testing ✅

- Development server runs successfully: `pnpm dev`
- TypeScript compilation passes: `pnpm typecheck`
- ESLint checks pass: `pnpm lint`
- Authentication flows working as expected

---

**Status**: Task completed successfully. Authentication system now features:
- **Seamless custom sign-in experience** within the application
- **Automatic redirection** for unauthenticated users  
- **Protected admin actions** with server-side authentication
- **Public join-call functionality** maintained
- **No sign-up capability** - sign-in only for existing users

**User Experience**: Unauthenticated users visiting `/` are automatically redirected to `/sign-in` for a seamless authentication flow, while join-call URLs remain publicly accessible.
